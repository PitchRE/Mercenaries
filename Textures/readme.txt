First off, Thank you for your comments!

Face Textures
--
This changes the textures in the native settings of Mount and Blade.

I bring to you a  small selection of 28 heads along with the 1 female/male body texture. If you would like to use this in any of your mods please give credit and post at the thread link below (I'm interested in mods :D)

Installation :
Place the files in 

C:\Program Files\Mount&Blade\Textures

*NOTE!
Remember to make backup the files, For easy access I recommend making a new folder in the Mount&blade directory titled "Backup" and copying the texture folder into the Backup folder.
